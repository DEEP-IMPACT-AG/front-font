# Group-design a `FRONT FONT`. Win an E-Scooter.
(Ok, not technically a font, just a sweet mess of web code and graphics :-) )

Design your own customized character and contribute it to the Front Font. If you participate you will automatically take part in a raffle for an electric scooter. Show off your skills, take a creative time-out from the talks, or just have some fun!

## How to contribute?

Please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo `git@github.com:DEEP-IMPACT-AG/front-font.git`
2. Choose a letter you want to customize
3. Create your own branch and work on the letter
3. After you're finished create a pull request to master
4. We will merge your pull request if it is not violating any of the house rules ðŸ‘‡.

## How to customize a letter

In the `public` folder you find a `.js` file for every character. You can write `css` and `html` directly into this file in the template section.

```html
const htmlTemplate = () => html`
<style>
  .letter {
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  /* your styles */
</style>
<span class="letter">
  B
</span>
<!-- your html -->
`;
```
Please only work on one character per pull request and don't change any of the other files. You are allowed to add other files for example `.svg` files in the public folder, if you need them for your character design. Pull requests that don't adhere to the guidelines will not be merged.

## Tipps and Tricks
Please always keep in mind that we want to create a responsive font.

- Don't use fixed `width` and `height` in your css, always use percentages
- If you use `svgs`, render them with `<img src="/your-svg.svg"` to make it responsive
- You can render images with strange aspect ratios as a background on a `<div>&nbsp;</div>`
- Don't use iframes
- Don't specify the font-size for the characters
- Be creative :)
